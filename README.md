# libgdx sbt project

Configure and generate a Scala project for [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) using [g8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8) and [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) 0.12.

## Setting up a new project

To use this template, you will need to install g8 first.
Consult g8's [readme](http://github.com/n8han/giter8#readme) for more information.

Then, in your favorite shell, type the command:

    $ g8 ajhager/libgdx-sbt-project

After filling in some information about your project, you can start placing your game's source files and assets in common/src/main/scala and common/src/main/resources, respectively.

## Managing your project

Update to the lastest libgdx nightlies (You will need to do this at least once):

    $ sbt
    > update-gdx 

Run the desktop project:

    > desktop/run

Package the desktop project into single jar:

    > assembly

Run the android project on a device:
  
    > android/start

Visit [android-plugin](https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin) for a more in-depth guide to android configuration and usage.

## Using unit tests

Run all unit tests from desktop, android and common (subdirectories src/test/scala):

    > test

Run specific set of unit tests:

    > common/test

## Using with popular IDEs

In most cases you will be able to open and edit each sub-project (like common, android or desktop), but you still need to use SBT to build the project though.

### Using with Eclipse

Add following line to your project/plugins.sbt file:

    addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.2.0")

Make sure you have Eclipse 3.7 and the latest ScalaIDE plugin, then type:

    $ sbt eclipse

Do not use version 2.3.0, because it isn't compatible with SBT 0.12.x, that is required for Android plugin.

### Using with Intellij Idea

Add following line to your project/plugins.sbt file:

    addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.5.1") 

Make sure you have Intellij Idea 12 and the latest Scala plugin, then type:

    $ sbt "project common" gen-idea

You can now open the project, then create an "Android Application" build config using the android module and an "Application" build config using the desktop module.

### Using with Netbeans

Add following line to your project/plugins.sbt file:

    addSbtPlugin("org.netbeans.nbsbt" % "nbsbt-plugin" % "1.0.2")

Make sure you have Netbeans 7.2 and the latest NBScala plugin, then type:

    $ sbt netbeans

### Using with Emacs/Sublime Text

Add following line to your project/plugins.sbt file:

    addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt-cmd" % "0.1.1")

Make sure you have EMACS 22 or Sublime Text Editor 2 with Sublime-ENSIME integration and the latest ENSIME plugin (0.9+), then type:

    $ sbt "ensime generate"

Do not use version 0.1.2, because it isn't compatible with SBT 0.12.x, that is required for Android plugin.
